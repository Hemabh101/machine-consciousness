# machine-consciousness
okay so here is the basic idea 
just like human can make decision based on their past exprience with someone we can use the same concept in machine 

for example lets take python: 
we can create a list which contins a few good and positive words like:nice,great,funny etc etc 
we can create another list which contains words not so positive like:bad,hate etc

now machine can store these words in a variable when every it is used in a sentance and rate the user in 1 to 100 per cent 

for example: someone uses nice and positive words in his conversation with the machine, the machine will rate the person lets say 78% and on the other hand there is another person who is a bit rude to the machine and the uses not so positive words in his conversation with the machine then the machine would rate the other person lower than the positive person lets say 50%

obsly when asked upon the machine would favour the person with rating of 78% 
we can also add other factor in rating like lying,truth,trust,emotional 
lets take another example: suppose the user is using kind of emotional words in his conversation with the machine then the machine would rate the user a bit higher in emotional sector of rating, now because the machine knows that this perticullar user is kind of emotional the next the user starts talking with the machine the machine would  use more positive/surppotive words and sentances 

this is really basic but i hope this helps in the explanation of the project
